\title{Assortative Mating with Vertical Cultural Transmission}
\usage{
AMVCT(h2.0, g0 = sqrt(h2.0/2), e = sqrt(1 - h2.0), r.ho, nu)
}
\arguments{
\item{h2.0}{Heritability in a population without assortative mating}

\item{g0}{Standard deviation of gametic value in a population without assortative mating}

\item{e}{Standard deviation of environmental effects}

\item{r.ho}{Correlation between mates}

\item{nu}{Correlation between parents' and offspring environmental effects}
}
\value{
an object of class 'AMVCT', which is a list with components
'g0', 'e', 'r.ho', 'nu', 'rho', 'a, 'sigma2', 'r.ga', 'g', 'h2.SNP',
'decompose.sigma2', 'cor.mates' (corresponding to table 1 of the supplementary material)
'cor.parent.offspring' (corresponding to table 2 of the supplementary material)
'cor.pheno.parent.offspring' (correlation of the phenotypes of parent and offspring).

\description{
Assortative Mating with Vertical Cultural Transmission
}
\details{
The user must provide 'r.ho' and 'nu', and either 'g0' and 'e', or 'h2.0'. 
The function will 
compute the principal quantities of interest defined in the paper. A method is
defined to have them printed nicely.
}
\examples{
AMVCT(g0 = sqrt(0.5), e = 1, r.ho = 0.6, nu = 0.4)
